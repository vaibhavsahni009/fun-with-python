# Pong

Pong game

could have more sounds

in case of mac change aplay to afplay but 

in case of windows its lengthy process

â€‹	try to use winsound.PlaySound('bounce.wav', winsound.SND_FILENAME)

can have better ball moving mechanism rather than depending on system speed 

could rely on recursion with ontimer as well turtle forward rather manually updating positions

could calibrate collisions in better way
