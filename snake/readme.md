# classic snake game

snake made with help of tech with tim at the moment of coding I did not completely understand the code as FCC was not that instructive but by investing some time with code and tweaking it here and there now understand how this works and its beautiful implementation.  
tweaks include score display , adding title, removal of unnecessary code while maintaining same functionality,etc   
could add music to it and some effects as well as high score database
